## `Colorful Console`
What is it about?
> Dye your console to light you up!

What does it contain?
> `./app/Utility/Dye.php` :  
>> Choose your favorite color for you texts and backgrounds!  
>> We have black, red, green, yellow, blue, purple, cyan, and white.  
>> Want more? Working on it!  
  
> `./app/Utility/Trace.php` :  
>> Let the color of your message becomes meaningful!  
>> Is your message conveying some information, warning, error, success, or yes-no option?  
>> We got it covered! We have some built-in themes for you already.  
  
> `./app/Utility/Config/trace.ini` :  
>> Wait, you don't like our built-in themes for `Trace.php`?  
>> No problem, customize them by yourself!  
>> Take a look of `Trace.php` so you will know how to build your favorite theme!  

But wait, there is more!
> `./app/Utility/CompanyLogo.php` :  
>> Let me see your hands, console artists! The console is our canvas!  
>> As a demo of `Dye.php`, I draw the logo of a company I interned using this program.  
>> Echo it in the console! Have fun :)
  
> `./app/Utility/Config/company_logo.txt` :  
>> Well, this is how I draw the company logo.  
>> Not an elegant way, but it works!

What does it contain?

>> You can even get a summay of it!  
  
> `./app/Utility/UniversalTimer` :  
>> What to track the runtime across multiple programs? No problem. This timer will live through the runtime.
